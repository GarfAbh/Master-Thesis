# Description

This is the logbook of my master thesis.
I will here describe all the step i followed during the whole project. The interrogation the solution I found how and why. the idea is to be able to reconstruct the whole process of the project i've made.

# Day 1

Setup of the github repo and also familiarisation with the developpement tools I'll use for the rest of the project. Also start to work on OSRM as suggested by my Supervisor.
I forked the repo and try to build / run it.
First issue : the osrm-example that should be install after the whole build and make process is not present.
I chated with some dev from OSRM developement team about that on https://webchat.oftc.net/

They are really cool and kindly answer to me but there is no evident solution at this point. I will then code my own test file to explore how the tool work.
