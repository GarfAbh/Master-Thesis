# Code architecture

## Data
This is where I'll put all the functionnality around the data. Conversion, normalisation, everything that need to be done on the data before I can use it is done by this package. Also all the functionnality that need to be use on the data after processing are there too.

## Engine
This is where I'll put the code relative to my algorithm and my way of answering to the given problem. This is the core of the project.

## Util
This is where I put some usefull functionality for the inside work.

## Interface
I'll probably need that to put here the needed interface to make anyone able to communicate with my code and use it's functionnality.

### Work in progress.
Before fixing this I wait for the teacher approval he may have some good tips to give before having to refactor the entire code to fit a new architecture.
